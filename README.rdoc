= MojiBake

* http://github.com/webmonks/mojibake

== Description

Mojibake occurs in English most frequently due to misinterpreting and
bad-transcoding between Windows-1252, ISO-8859-1, and UTF-8. This
module provides a mojibake sequence to original character mapping
table, and utility to recover mojibake’d text.

Testing has been with English but other Latin based languages, where
Windows-1252 is in the wild, should also benefit.

== Dependencies

Mojibake mappings generation requires the String encoding support in
ruby 1.9 as provided by:

* ruby 1.9.2+ (tested 1.9.2p290, Linux)
* jruby 1.6.5+ (tested 1.6.5, Linux)
* ruby 2.0.0 (tested 2.0.0p0, Linux)

Recovery of text with default settings is supported by using the
pre-generated table.json when in ruby 1.8 mode.

== Synopsis

 gem install mojibake

 require 'mojibake'
 mapper = MojiBake::Mapper.new
 mapper.recover( 'â€œquotedâ€�' ) #=> '“quoted”'

Or via cli:

 mojibake -h

List the mojibake mapping table (output in UTF-8):

 mojibake -t

Recover from a text file:

 mojibake input.txt
